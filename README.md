File Organizer
The File Organizer is a Python script designed to organize files from the Downloads folder into categorized folders based on their file extensions. It helps keep your files neatly organized, making it easier to locate and manage them.

Features
Automatically sorts files into designated folders based on their file types.
Supports common file types such as images, documents, videos, and audio files.
Customizable destination folders to suit your preferences.
Easy to use and can be run with a simple command.
Prerequisites
Python 3.x installed on your system.
Basic knowledge of running Python scripts from the command line.
Usage
Clone the repository to your local machine or download the Python script (download_sort.py) directly.
Ensure that Python 3.x is installed on your system.
Navigate to the directory containing the Python script (download_sort.py) using the command line or terminal.
Run the script by executing the following command:
python download_sort.py
The script will scan the Downloads folder, categorize files based on their extensions, and move them to the appropriate destination folders.
Check the designated folders (e.g., myPictures, myDocuments, myVideos, myMusic, myOther) on your desktop to find the organized files.
Configuration
